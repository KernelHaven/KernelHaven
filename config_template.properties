# Configuration file documentation for KernelHaven
#
# This file lists all known configuration options that are available for
# KernelHaven. Note that some plugins may define their own settings, that are
# not listed in this file. However, this file should cover the most common
# plugins.
#
# This configuration file is a standard Java Properties file (see the
# documentation of java.util.Properties). A properties file is a key-value
# storage in the format: key = value. Lines starting with a hash (#) are
# comments and not considered in parsing. Multiple lines can be joined together
# with a backslash (\) character directly in front of the line break. This is
# useful for multi-line values or formatting.
#
# This file lists the keys for the settings defined in the main infrastructure,
# followed by the settings of common plugins. Each setting has a short
# description, that contains:
#  * An explanation text for the setting.
#  * The type of setting (see below for a list possible types).
#  * For enums: The possible values.
#  * The default value for the setting, if it specifies one.
#  * If no default value is specified: Whether the setting is mandatory or not.
#
# Possible setting types are:
#  * String: A simple text value.
#  * Integer: An integer value. An exception is generated if this is not a valid
#             integer.
#  * Boolean: A boolean value. Everything except "true" (case insensitive) is
#             considered to be the value false.
#  * Regular Expression: A Java regular expression. See the documentation for
#                        java.util.regex.Pattern class.
#  * Path: A path value. The file denoted by this does not have to exist.
#  * Existing File: A path value for an existing file. If the specified file
#                   does not exist, then an exception is thrown. This can either
#                   be relative to the current working directory or an absolute
#                   path.
#  * Existing Directory: A path value for an existing directory. If the
#                        specified directory does not exist, then an exception
#                        is thrown. This can either be relative to the current
#                        working directory or an absolute path.
#  * Enum: One value of an enumartion of possible values. Not case sensitive.
#  * Comma separated list of strings: A comma separated list of string values.
#  * List of setting keys: A list of string values created from multiple setting
#                          keys. The base key is appended by a .0 for the first
#                          value. The following values increase this integer.
#                          For example:
#                            key.0 = a
#                            key.1 = b
#                            key.2 = c
#                          Defines the list ["a", "b", "c"].
